## Hi there 👋

<!--
Based on your history, I've updated the project list to focus on your most technically complex work—specifically highlighting your **mobile deployment** work, **desktop development**, and **OCR/Computer Vision** integrations, which are high-value for a Software Engineer profile.

---

### README.md

I’m a Software Engineer based in **Mexico**. I specialize in building scalable applications with **React** and **TypeScript**, with a strong focus on backend automation and AI integration.

**These days I’m focused on:**

* **React, TypeScript & SQL**
* AI-driven automation & Chatbot architecture
* API Integration & System Deployment

**Some stuff I built:**

* **Android App Deployment** – Currently managing the configuration and release pipeline for a mobile application via Google Play Console.
* **OCR Identity Pipeline** – A complex automation system that uses Computer Vision to extract, verify, and digitize ID data from physical documents.
* **Windows System Utility** – A desktop application (*UnlockMyPC*) designed for local system management and access control.
* **Telegram-React Bridge** – An event-driven interface that allows remote control of a digital display wall through real-time messaging.

**Fun Facts:**
